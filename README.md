## **_Description_**

#### Our project is a full-stack e-commerce platform for electronics that removes the need for physical store visits by allowing customers to browse a wide range of products with detailed descriptions, images, and specifications, all updated in real time. Users can add items to their basket for a smooth and secure checkout experience, with multiple payment options and fast delivery. For store managers, the platform includes an admin dashboard to add new products so customers can purchase them, as well as delete outdated or out-of-stock items to make room for new ones, ensuring the store is always accurate, fresh, and up to date.

## **_Technologies Used_**

- **React** â€“ Frontend UI library for building interactive interfaces
- **Node.js** â€“ JavaScript runtime environment for backend services
- **Express.js** â€“ Backend framework for handling routes and APIs
- **MongoDB** â€“ NoSQL database for storing application data
- **CSS** â€“ Styling and layout design
- **RESTful APIs** â€“ Communication between frontend and backend
- **MERN Stack** â€“ Combination of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node for full-stack development

### **_Getting Started_**

##### Upon opening the website, the user will immediately see the available types of electronic devices displayed on the homepage, allowing them to easily explore the categories and choose the section they want to shop from.
